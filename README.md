# ArtX-Next-Gen-Scalable-Hybrid-Architecture-for-Fine-Art-Style-Classification

ArtX: Next-Gen Scalable Hybrid Architecture for Fine Art Style Classification is an innovative deep learning project dedicated to transforming the way we classify and recognize art styles and authorship. The project combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer models to deliver a robust, scalable solution for both traditional and modern artworks, offering superior accuracy and reliability in art style classification and authorship attribution.

ArtX tackles key challenges in art recognition, such as limited data availability and the intricacies of fine art details, by leveraging cutting-edge AI techniques. The hybrid model extracts local features through CNNs, capturing fine brushstrokes, textures, and color gradients, while the Transformer module models global dependencies to fully understand the composition and context of the artwork. This fusion enables ArtX to excel in recognizing diverse art styles across a wide range of cultural backgrounds, from Chinese paintings to iconic oil works, pushing the boundaries of automated art classification.

Key Features:
- Hybrid Architecture: Combines CNNs and Transformers for enhanced local and global feature extraction.
- Data Augmentation: Utilizes advanced augmentation strategies to improve generalization on smaller datasets.
- Multi-Dataset Training: Trained on diverse and challenging datasets, including both Chinese and oil paintings.
- High-Performance Classification: Achieves significant improvements in classification accuracy and F1-scores across different art styles.
- Open-Source Platform: Provides a flexible and accessible solution for researchers and developers in the art recognition field.

ArtX offers a powerful toolset for art historians, researchers, and AI enthusiasts looking to explore the intersection of deep learning and fine art, enabling better understanding, preservation, and automated analysis of artworks from different periods and genres.
