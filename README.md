# ArtX-Deep-Learning-for-Art-Style-and-Authorship-Recognition

ArtX is an advanced deep learning project focused on the recognition of art styles and authorship, aiming to revolutionize the way we analyze and categorize artworks. By combining the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, ArtX effectively classifies traditional and modern artworks, improving accuracy and robustness in identifying art styles and attributing works to their respective creators.

This project leverages cutting-edge AI techniques to enhance the recognition process of Chinese and oil paintings, addressing challenges like small datasets and intricate artwork details. By extracting both local features (via CNN) and capturing global dependencies (via Transformer), ArtX provides a comprehensive solution for artwork recognition, contributing to areas such as cultural heritage preservation, art market analysis, and automated art classification.

Features:
Fusion Model: Combines CNN and Transformer models to capture both local and global features.
Data Augmentation: Uses advanced techniques to enhance model generalization on small datasets.
Multi-Dataset Support: Trained on diverse datasets, including Chinese and oil painting collections.
State-of-the-Art Performance: Achieves significant improvements in classification accuracy and F1 scores.
ArtX provides an open-source platform for researchers and developers interested in applying deep learning techniques to art recognition tasks.
